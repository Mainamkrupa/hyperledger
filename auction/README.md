## Auction sample

The auction sample provides a set of smart contracts and tutorials that implement a series of distributed auctions. Each example uses important Fabric features such as private data, access control, and state-based endorsement.

- [Simple blind auction](simple-blind-auction): This example implements an auction where a single good is sold to the highest bidder. Because the tutorial provides more details on how the auction is implemented, users should go through this example first.
- [Dutch auction](dutch-auction): This example implements an auction in which multiple items of the same type can be sold to more than one buyer.
